# Morse
In a generation where communication is necessary, deaf and dumb people face a lot of hardship in communication.
Morse code is taught to these people in their primary standards and hence can be used efficiently to communicate with them. This project converts the MORSE CODE into a audio output through a touch sensor.
when the user wishes to communicate he can tap on the touch sensor and the device will convert it into an audio output.
